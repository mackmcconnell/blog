Dorothy Parker was an Americain poet, short-story writer, critic, satirist and screenwriter. Her sucesses include two Academy Awards nominations, however her involvement in left-wing politics led to a Hollywood's blacklist. 

Her taste for alcohol is said to come from an unhappy childhood and several failed marriages and relansionships, but she was an independent nature and didn't seem to mind having several affaires at the same time. She deplored however, to have put "all her eggs in one bastard". 

One of her most famoust poem speaks about her taste for whiskey and independance:
I wish I could drink like a lady
I can take one or two at the most
Three and I'm under the table
Four and I'm under the host
